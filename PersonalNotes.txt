Midyear review:
https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/analytics.html
This link talks about how to add analytics API to kestrel.

So far, I have set it up such that I can run a python function, and have it interact with the virustotal api in different ways depending on the arguments.
That means I am mostly complete with the Python Analytics Interface.

According to the aformentioned link, the next kind of analytics kestrel supports is a Docker Analytics Interface.
To be perfectly honest, I have not used Docker before, but I intend to learn it.


10/31/2022:
Talked to the external project lead. I won't be using Docker (yet) instead I will integrate the API, which is 
currently an isolated python program, with the Kestrel language.

This documentation will surely be helpful.
