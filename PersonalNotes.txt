This link talks about how to add analytics API to kestrel.

So far, I have set it up such that I can run a python function, and have it interact with the virustotal api in different ways depending on the arguments.
That means I am mostly complete with the Python Analytics Interface.

According to the aformentioned link, the next kind of analytics kestrel supports is a Docker Analytics Interface.
To be perfectly honest, I have not used Docker before, but I intend to learn it.
